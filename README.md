### Description

This was a group attempt at simulating a file system using C++. The end result does not function but it was still a valuable learning experience.

## Build
Use the Makefile to build the project.

## Instructions
The program runs as a fake shell with some simple commands that are documented in `main.cpp`. Though the program does not function and will probably segfault when run.
